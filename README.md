## Overview

Teams Meeting Reporter (TMR) is a Python application designed to automate the process of sending Teams Meeting reports to all meeting participants via Microsoft Outlook. It operates in the background and periodically checks the download folder for CSV files with the keyword 'Attendance report' in their filenames. If such a file is found and hasn't already been processed, the application prompts the user to decide whether they want to send an email to the meeting participants.
